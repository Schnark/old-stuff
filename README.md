This repository contains all my "old" code, i.e. code that hasn't been published before, which I (probably) will no longer work on.

Note that most of this code is commented in German (if at all), and the really old code uses code page 850 as text encoding. If something doesn't work, it could be due to a missing library that isn't included for legal reasons, because it relies on some internals of MS-DOS 6, or because it never worked at all.

They are roughly grouped into several folders:

* QBasic: Old code written in QBasic. (starting in 2001, until 2004)
* Asm: Old code written with `debug.exe` in assembler. (2002)
* ti-83: Old code written for a TI-83. These are from a backup on paper, and not directly usable (2003 to 2005)
* Turbo: Old code written in Turbo Pascal 6. Some are ports of QBasic programs. This also includes my participations in the "Bundeswettbewerb Informatik", and some programs written in school. (2004 to 2007)
* Shell: Some not so really old shell/perl/etc. scripts, most of these have something to do with Wikipedia.
* JS: Some not so really old or unfinished JS scripts. The subfolder `wp` contains unfinished JS scripts (and some other stuff) written for Wikipedia.

If I decide to abandon a yet unfinished and unpublished program, I might add it to this repository, and I might also add some more explanations to the programs, but I wo'n't otherwise update anything in here.
